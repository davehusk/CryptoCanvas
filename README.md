# CryptoCanvas.py:  Encryption Playground

Experiment with encryption techniques, mathematical patterns, and the art of concealing data within plain sight!  CryptoCanvas lets you play with:

* **Standard Strength:** Industry-trusted AES encryption keeps your secrets under lock and key.

* **Fibonacci Fun:** See how the famous number sequence can be used to scramble messages.

* **Pi Power:** Leverage digits of Pi as an unconventional ingredient in your secret recipes. 

* **Hidden Images:** Practice the subtle art of steganography by embedding images within other images.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x 
* Required Libraries: cryptography, matplotlib, numpy, mpmath, secrets

**Installation (pip):**

```bash
pip install cryptography matplotlib numpy mpmath secrets
```

## Quick Usage Example

1.  **Generate Secrets:**
    ```python
     unique_image_key = generate_unique_image()
     pi_digits = str(mpmath.pi * 10**10000)[2:].remove('e') 
    ```

2.  **Test Encryption:**
    ```python
    data_to_encrypt = "Your top-secret message here!"

    # AES Encryption
    aes_key = secrets.token_bytes(16)
    aes_encrypted, aes_decrypted = aes_encrypt_decrypt(data_to_encrypt, aes_key)

    # PiEncrypt  
    pi_encrypted, pi_decrypted = piencrypt_encrypt_decrypt(data_to_encrypt, pi_digits)

    # ... explore Fibonacci encryption and image steganography!
    ```

## Notes

* Remember, strong encryption should rely on proven tools. AES is a solid choice. The custom PiEncrypt and Fibonacci schemes are provided for experimental interest.
* Key protection is paramount!
